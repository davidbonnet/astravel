üëü A tiny and fast [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compliant AST walker and modifier.

### Key features

- Works on [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compliant ASTs such as the ones produced by [Meriyah](https://github.com/meriyah/meriyah).
- Out-of-the-box functions such as source code comments insertion for [Astring](https://github.com/davidbonnet/astring).
- No dependencies and small footprint.

## Installation

Install with the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astravel):

```bash
npm install astravel
```

Alternatively, checkout this repository and install the development dependencies to build the module file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidbonnet/astravel.git
cd astravel
npm install
```

## Usage

The `astravel` module exports the following items:

<!-- MarkdownTOC autolink="true" levels="4" -->

- [`defaultTraveler`](#defaulttraveler)
- [`makeTraveler()`](#maketraveler)
- [`attachComments()`](#attachcomments)

<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->

#### `defaultTraveler`

> ‚¨ÖÔ∏è `traveler`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated in favor of ES6 class notation.

This object describes a basic AST traveler. It contains the following methods:

- `go(node, state)`: Travels through the provided AST `node` with a given `state` (an object that can be of any type) by recursively calling this method.
- `find(predicate, node, state) ‚ûû { node, state }?`: Returns `{ node, state }` for which `predicate(node, state)` returns truthy, starting at the specified AST `node` and with the provided `state`. Otherwise, returns `undefined`.
- `[NodeType](node, state)`: Method handler for a specific `NodeType`.
- `makeChild(properties) ‚ûû traveler`: Returns a custom AST traveler that inherits from `this` traveler with its own provided `properties` and the property `super` that points to `this` traveler.

#### `makeTraveler()`

> ‚û°Ô∏è `(properties)`
> ‚¨ÖÔ∏è `traveler`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated in favor of ES6 class notation.

This function is similar to `astravel.defaultTraveler.makeChild`: it returns a traveler that inherits from the `defaultTraveler` with its own provided `properties` and the property `super` that points to the `defaultTraveler` object. These properties should redefine the traveler's behavior by implementing the `go(node, state)` method and/or any node handler.

When redefining the `go` method, make sure its basic functionality is kept by calling the parent's `go` method to keep traveling through the AST:

```javascript
const customTraveler = makeTraveler({
  go: function (node, state) {
    // Code before entering the node
    console.log('Entering ' + node.type)
    // Call the parent's `go` method
    this.super.go.call(this, node, state)
    // Code after leaving the node
    console.log('Leaving ' + node.type)
  },
})
```

To skip specific node types, the most effective way is to replace the corresponding node handlers with a function that does nothing:

```javascript
import { makeTraveler } from 'astravel'

const ignore = Function.prototype
const customTraveler = makeTraveler({
  FunctionDeclaration: ignore,
  FunctionExpression: ignore,
  ArrowFunctionExpression: ignore,
})
```

#### `attachComments()`

> ‚û°Ô∏è `(ast, comments)`
> ‚¨ÖÔ∏è `ast`

This function attaches a list of `comments` to the corresponding nodes of a provided `ast` and returns that same `ast`. The `ast` is modified in-place and only the nodes getting comments are augmented with a `comments` and/or a `trailingComments` array property.

Each comment should be an object with the following properties:

- `type`: `"Line"` or `"Block"`
- `value`: Comment string value
- `start`: Comment starting character offset number
- `end`: Comment ending character offset number
- `loc`: Location object with `start` and `end` properties containing one-based `line` number and zero-based `column` number properties.

The following examples show how to obtain a proper list of `comments` of a given source `code` and how to attach them on the generated `ast`:

##### Usage with [Meriyah](https://github.com/meriyah/meriyah)

```javascript
import { parse } from 'meriyah'
import { attachComments } from 'astravel'

const comments = []
const ast = parse(code, {
  // Comments are stored in this array
  onComment: comments,
})
// Attach comments on the AST
attachComments(ast, comments)
```

##### Usage with [Acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn)

```javascript
import { parse } from 'acorn'
import { attachComments } from 'astravel'

const comments = []
const ast = parse(code, {
  // This ensures that the `loc` property is present on comment objects
  locations: true,
  onComment: comments,
})
attachComments(ast, comments)
```

The algorithm assumes that comments are not put in exotic places, such as in-between function arguments, and proceeds as follows:

- For a given statement, it stores all comments right above it and on the same line to it's right side in a `comments` property.
- If a comment block is at the beginning of a code block, it is attached to that code block.
- Comments not followed by any statement in a code block are attached as `trailingComments` to that code block.

In this example, the comments tell to which statement they are attached:

```javascript
// Attached to the variable declaration just below
const point = {
  // Attached to the property definition just below
  x: 0,
  y: 0, // Attached to the property definition on its left
}
/*
Attached to the function declaration just below.
*/
function add(a, b) {
  /*
   Attached to the function body because it is the first comment block.
   */
  return a + b // Attached to the return statement on its left
  // Trailing comment attached as such to the function body
}
// Trailing comment attached as such to the program body
```
